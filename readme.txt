Sylink:
This powershell script generates a sylink.xml file for each SEPM group in groups.txt.
The sylink.xml files can be used on Symantec Endpoint Protection agents to direct them to a new SEPM and join the specified group.

Setup:
This script automates updating a Symantec Endpoint Protection setup file with a new Sylink.xml.  This is useful if you need to generate a large number of setup.exe files, and you have used the Sylink script to generate a number of sylink.xml's to point SEP clients at a different SEPM.
